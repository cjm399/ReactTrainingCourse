React notes, should have started this earlier -_-

Basic React uses a couple different pieces.
  -index.html (basic HTML to insert our react into)
  -src/index.js (brings the page together and inserts it into the HTML DOM)

After this there are components, each component has display information at minimum
NOTE: components do NOT need to extend React Components, they can simply be a const function.

Class Components will also need to be aware of other components and have their own state,
this is initialized in the constructor.

ie. constructor()
{
  this.state = {
  piece1: null,
  piece2: 4
  }
}

calling super(props) will inherit the props.

The components being described are "dumb components" and do not integrate with Redux.

Components that integrate with Redux AKA "smart components" are actually called containers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Containers are used to couple together reducers and components, because redux will be handing the
data you will want to link them together so that you can access the overall state information.

to do this you need to...
  -include connect from react-redux
  -make use of the mapStateToProps function.
  -at the bottom write, "export default connect(mapStateToProps)(ComponentClassName)"
